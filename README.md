# directory-to-prompt
Python script that generates a prompt for LLMs to understand the contents of a file directory.


Add any folders/files you want to exclude, then run to create the text file containing the prompt.


The file will look something like this:

pages/_app.js:

*contents of file*

--------------------------

pages/index.jsx:

*contents of file*

--------------------------
